# Checklist
## Third-Party Libraries
- [x] TPL00: We are utilizing the latest available stable version of the libraries where possible
- [x] TPL01: We have a plan to review GitHub vulnerability alerts
## Client Data Storage
- [x] DAS00: We are not storing userâ€™s password in the client
- [x] DAS01: No sensitive data is included in backups generated by native clients
- [x] DAS02: We are not hardcoding any keys or secrets
- [x] DAS03: We remove user cached data when the user logout
## APIs
### Access Control Verification
- [x] ACC00: When our API is called by an unauthenticated user / non-permissioned user, that it denies access appropriately
- [x] ACC01: When our API needs to be restricted based on an access control consideration, we check for those conditions before performing any actions
- [x] ACC02: We use a consistent parser/encoder across all API components
- [x] ACC03: We don't expose sensitive information (such as PII or serial numbers) in URLs
### Authentication
- [x] AUTH00: We are only using appropriate authentication providers
- [x] AUTH01: We are not sending authentication tokens into logs
- [x] AUTH02: If we are using STS we have a plan to move to IDS or Auth0
## General Guidance
- [x] GEN00: We have a Threat Model for our project
- [x] GEN01: We have thought about the default settings of this feature/project to ensure they are as secure and de-permissioned as possible
- [x] GEN02: We have checked for dead code, and deleted it. Less code = fewer bugs!
- [x] GEN03: We have restricted access to production systems and data as much as possible
- [x] GEN04: We have stored our secrets in a safe place such as AWS Parameter Store
## O&A Support
- [x] O&A00: We use Checkmarx to scan our code for potential vulnerabilities
- [x] O&A01: We have considered using GitHub to store our code
- [x] O&A02: We have considered using Jupiter for hosting
- [x] O&A03: We have considered using Buildkite for CI/CD
- [x] O&A04: We have considered using Sumo for our logging
- [x] O&A05: We have considered using Jaeger for our application tracing
## Privacy
- [x] PRI00: We only utilize third-party services supported by O&A
- [x] PRI01: We have ensured that error messages don't leak sensitive information (debug/callstack/full objects) to a user
